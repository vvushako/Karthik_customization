We use technology that many other websites employ, including, without limitation, cookies, to collect information such as the aforementioned. We may also use such cookies to collect information in connection with future visits from that Site, to recognize you as a previous visitor and to track your activity on the Site. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of the Site might not work without cookies. We reserve our right to also use other technologies such as Internet tags, web beacons, and navigational data collection tools (log files, server logs, or click stream).

<p><strong>Combinations:</strong> We may combine passively tracked data with data that you actively submit so as to, for instance, provide better service to Site visitors, customize the Site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends, to otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use, and to personalize offers (for example, combined information may allow us to recommend products to you based on what you have liked in the past).</p>

This coding makes it extremely difficult for anyone to reach your information as it moves through our ordering system.</p>
	<p>Certain browsers will not allow communication through secure servers. If this is the case, you won't be able to place an order online. If you have any problems placing an order online please print your shopping page and place your order by phone at 866-280-7620.</p>
	<p>To check the security of your computer, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window if you are using Netscape, or the lower right-hand corner of your browser window if you are using Internet Explorer. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, then the encryption technology is active and the server is secure. You can also check by looking at the URL line of your browser; when you access a secure server, the initial characters of the site address will be 'https.'</p>
	
	<h2>What if you link to another site? </h2>
	<p>Our website may provide links to other websites that are not under our control. Neither we nor the third party service providers who manage our website are responsible for these linked websites, their content or for the actions of the providers of such sites. We recommend that you review the privacy and security policies and terms of use for any websites you use.</p>
	
	<h2>Do I have to turn the security feature on when I want to shop?</h2>
	<p>The security features are automatic, and always on. You don't have to do anything but shop. Clicking 'Checkout' on any page is all it takes to get started in our secure checkout process.</p>
	
	<h2>How do I know if I'm connected when I start ordering? </h2>
	<p>Once you've clicked the 'Continue Checkout' button, your browser looks for a digital certificate to confirm that it's communicating with our web-site. Once a positive ID is made, your order will continue securely.</p>
	
	<h2>Are all the pages on your web-site secure?</h2>
	<p>Most of the pages on our website provide information about Solstice Sunglasses and our products. We make this information available freely and there's no reason for these pages to be 'secure.' The pages that we make secure are the ones on which you actually make the purchase, such as when managing your account, checking your order status, or within the 'Checkout' area. For example, the entire checkout process, from introduction to final confirmation, is completely secure.</p>
	
	<h2>Is my information secure when it's transmitted across the Internet? </h2>
	<p>All of your information is encrypted before it's transmitted across the Internet, then decoded only after it arrives at our secure servers.</p>
	
	<h2>Consent</h2>
	<p>We take the privacy rights of users of this Site very seriously and this Privacy Policy explains to You how certain information about You may be processed.</p>
